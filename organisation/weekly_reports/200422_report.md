# Report wednesday April 22th
Egidius is absent.

## Project Board

### Workflow: Just one approval and then done
Not much to say, things go their way.

### FA and check dictionary
Made huge steps. Dutch pipeline fully implemented. Frisian almost. Small tweaking needed in the next week.

### Segmentation checker
Got praat working and know how to render and export a png. Making everything interactive is a whole lot more effort.

### User login
Is done.

## Client meeting
We had a meeting with the client, specifically about the segmentation checker. They restated their priorities:

prio 1:
- ability to upload multiple files at once
- g2p for Frisian

prio 2:
- Testing
- User feedback van Wieke
- Analysis scripts working

## Next week
One team will finish the FA and than will continue with tweaking the frontend. Frontend tweaking 

So testing
Unit and integration
System testing
1 team: finalize FA with multiple file upload and later on small UI changes to polish it (not being able to click ahead in pipeline)
2 team: test upload stuff

## Planning for the rest of the sprint
- This week: Finish FA, start user testing, polish frontend, unit testing 4 days.
- Next two weeks: Mooooooreeee tests for upload, check dict and FA. Add Frisian. Write CLAM-scripts/ish for segmentation checker.
