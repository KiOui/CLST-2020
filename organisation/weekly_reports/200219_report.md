# Report wednesday Februari 19
This is the third weekly report. From now on we will be sending bi-weekly reports

# Second client meeting
__In Short__
We have gathered feedback on our initial design ideas, both on the Graphical User Interface and on the more techincal side. The client liked our idea of the webportal. The client had additional requirements for us, and we took note of them. We made clear to the client that in the first sprint we would focus on the MVP which only includes 'Forced Alignment' with adio and ortographic transcription as a 'perfect' input. The output will be an automatic segmented file that comes out. This is based on the funcitonality of already working parts that the client delivered to us. It is up to us to get these basic parts working.

__More specifically (they're details, feel free to skip them)__
Idea of web portal is liked, and from the viewpoint of maintainability this is good. They use the web for other speech recognition as well and it works nicely. Sequencing the portal is nice - that it becomes a sequence as we had in thought.

__Must have__
We assume all input is perfect; it's delivered in the perfect format and does not need further conversion. 

| Task                                   | Done? |
|----------------------------------------|--|
| Input Audio+orthographic transcription|❌|
| Do FA (with Ponyland)|❌|
| Output Automatic segmentation|❌|

__Should have__
| Task                                   | Done? |
|----------------------------------------|--|
| Check lexicon, add words to it if needed|❌|
| Support additional functionality of Praat scripts|❌|
| Check and review the FA, support re-alignment|❌|

Some context:
- For FA (Check and review if needed, which is a step only needed after FA. I.e. it can be off track and then it keeps like that, then you want to manually correct this.) 
- Graphyphonym? Written-sound - could be done automatically. There are dutch and English modules that can do this. Written words come in and sounds come out. But also here could be the case that the user would want to intervene. That is adding words to the lexicon. Could be that the user wants to intervene manually. So if you have to, add words to the lexicon and then to FA. 

Generic tips:
- Don't try and add user access management into the tool. Not that many people use it anyway, and there is little added benefit.
- Don't worry about the file size you are working with
- Praat has lots of documentation which you should consult when needed
- Let's involve the end users in every step of the process

Some feedback on our GUI
Going back should be possible in every step. 
And the idea of doing it step by step is good 
But if you go back you should overwrite what you had. If necessary when you click different things. But do show a pop-up to make clear that you are overwriting. 

Button should be for where the tasks are, for if they have to do assignments.
