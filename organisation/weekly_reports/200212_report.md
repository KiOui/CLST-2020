# Report wednesday Februari 12

This is the second weekly-ish report. Thanks for reading!

## First client meeting
Yesterday we (three managers and two engineers) first met with the client. They are AI programmers and familiar with the common struggles of programming and concepts such as Agile Programming, which is really nice.

They explained their project goal and gave us some more details. We walked through a the most basic user story and got an idea of the technicalities.
 
A full outline of this talk can be found in our gitrepo.

## The internal meeting
Today we had a meeting with our engineers. In this meeting we decided that we wanted to build a web app, since most scripts work on Linux or are easily embeddable on a Linux server. Our second option was to build a Windows specific app, but this doesn't really yield any benefits. We are now waiting for the clients approval, since this is a big decision and we don't want to spend our resources without the clients consent.

Next, we split our team in three groups:
- User story: 2 people worked out a user story by drawing out the whole front-end
- Back-end framework: 3 people sought out a framework for the back-end
- Domain Specific Knowledge: 2 people looked into the documents that we got from the client and figured out how to embed the different tools into one dashboard. Their findings are in the repo, but they need the concrete tools to complete their documentation.

We decided we wanted to go with the Django framework in Python. We gave all our engineers the excercice to watch a YouTube video of half an hour that takes you through the basic Django library.

We e-mailed the client asking if they agree with building a web app and if they can give us the specific 'praat'-tools so that we can move on with the project. This email can be found in our git repoand will be meeting them next tuesday. This time more engineers are able to come and we strive to have all engineers meet the client at least once before we start the sprint.
