# Report wednesday April 29th (optional)
Everyone is present!

## Project Board

### Frontend polish
Lot of small issues. We need to put specific people on them.

### Testing
Andere Lars had no time to work, but will compensate next week.
View_generic is untestable, but it's OK since its concrete instances are tested.
A lot of pull requests still need to be approved. Your work is not done once you submit a pull request, it's done once your request is merged with master.

### Functional FA2
We need to look at the full filenames to distinguish the input and output .tg files.
Note: By default Windows hides filenames, we might need to add something about that in the README's.
Permission system is sort of working on master. Lars accidentally deleted 3 lines. It's working locally, so should be fixable easily.

### Extensive README's and Tutorials
Haven't worked on it yet.

### Deploy Plan
It's now deployed on clst.giphouse.nl.
TODO Manager: Mail Joren to keep it a bit longer in the air so the client can test around in the summer.

## Next week

### Functional FA2 + Frontend polish
David and Valentijn will finish the frontend polish and the floating random issues.

Lars and Egidius will work on the nice fix for filehandling so the FA2 is up and running. Then they will continue with multiple file handling.

### Testing
Andere Lars and Michel will continue writing tests for scripts.py
The rest is well covered.

### README's + tutorials
Matti and Martin will write github wiki pages. It's got to be accessable for linguistics students, so we won't use Latex and the likes.
