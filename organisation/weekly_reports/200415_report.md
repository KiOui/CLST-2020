# Report wednesday April 15th
## Project Board
### Workflow: Just one approval and then done
Less pull requests than normal. Probably due to the exams/resits.

There is a long running issue called "Check into pydocstyle" but it's really low priority and not meaningful at all so we can safely drop it.

### FA and check dictionary
FA is working! Now doing g2p part. After this week the first part of pipeline is done!
All the functions you need for is all in the process model. An example is worked out by Michel and Lars.

### Segmentation checker
Split up in three tasks:
- Interacting with CLAM-server: Getting documentation 
- Make interface like in the slides
- Textgridfile editabe and savable: Done, but not merged into master yet.

None of the other subparts is merged.

We sent a mail to Louis to ask for a visualising tool.

### User login
Logging in with s-numbers not needed anymore, so we will scrap that requirement.

## Going through the Front-end
Problem: Uploading files is now gone. This has to do with the change in filepaths/restructuring of the /media/ folder.

Forgotten password is not working locally. You can use the builtins in the Django framework. Won't work locally, but eventually will work when Django is deployed.
Probably done this week. Lars/Michel are willing to help.

## Testing
Due to the nature of our tool, our testing is mainly integration which can only be done once we have settled on a structure and have most things up and running. This is next week.

Before writing tests for the FA and other CLAM-server stuff we need
- Fixtures: proper database entries/files to test upon

## Planning for the rest of the sprint
- This week: Finish upload, check dict and FA. Continue working on segmentation checker
- Next two weeks: Write tests for upload, check dict and FA. Add Frisian. Write CLAM-scripts/ish for segmentation checker.
