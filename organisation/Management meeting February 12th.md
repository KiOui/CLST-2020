# Management meeting February 12th
Preference of programming language for GUI is **python**. It connects well with our parts and it is documented well. There are libraries for making a GUI in windows. The framework we still have to choose.

We need to check pipeline docs in class. Make sure you catch up if you’ve missed it. 

Happy flow: all data will be delivered in perfect required format. Later on we will look into exceptions, but for now we make a ‘minimum valuable product’

**List of tasks**:

* Framework research mostly for back-end, class interface -- 2 engineers // back-end | (Martin, Lars, Michel)
* List input and output of pipeline and research the input types for each of the scripts to see how conversion etc can/should be done -- 2 engineers // backend | (Valentijn, Egidius, Matti)
* Paper GUI design of the tool -- 2 engineers // frontend / design | (Valentijn also, David + for brainstorming Martin, Lars)
    * Sketch interface according to workflow of pipelines 
        * Should it become 1 centralized class in which we run all functions? Or should it become multiple classes per function, 1 function per class?
        * In which class do we save audio and edits?
