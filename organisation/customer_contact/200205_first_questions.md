## Client Session 1 questions
- Would the client be open for a web based solution?

> _Preferrably we would build a webportal in which the processes are steered and communicated to a server on which the scripts are run._
  - [ ] Virtual machine / Virtual environment
  - [ ] Webportal
  - [ ] Application (desktop)
- Is the meta analysis something the clients wants done in the tool or is that something the customer / user does him/herself?

> _How high is this on the priority list. I think we would prefer to focus on getting the portal / environment up and running with full (existing) script support, before we would invest in extra meta analysis for the FA content._
  - What is the meta analysis that the client referred to. What would be the requirements around this?
  
> _Again, this might be something we should / would collect later on in the process, depending on the impression of the first questions_
- Is the environment / portal ment for data collection and conversion to a centralised format or does the environment / portal required possibility to actually run the scripts for users / customers?
- Is security part of the system requirements in these early development stages or are we just focussing on functionality?
- What is the targeted user group? 
  - [ ] Age selection
  - [ ] Profession selection
  - [ ] Function selection
  - [ ] Role selection
  
> _What are the critera for defining a user within this system?_
- Does the client want to export the result of the scripts to a formatted data file (_for example something compatible with Excel \~ CSV_)? 
- Does the client want to be able to manipulate or edit the results from the scripts within the portal or environment?
  - Does the client want to be able to manipulate or edit results from the scripts at a later time as well?
  
> _Focussing on the requirement of a login feature with this question. If the user should have the capability to view and possibly edit results at a later point in time, this also has consequences for the size of the server he should rent._
- Does the client want to be able to only export parts of the results from the scripts, or only the full file size?
