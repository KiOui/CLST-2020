# Client meeting March 17th 2020

Contact the following two people:

- Maarten van Gompel
- Loui ten bosch

They are also making a service for after editing and we can perhaps communicate with them. 

To do tasks (with priority):

- Contact Maarten & Louis
- Support login (users)
- File upload
- Clam server
- FA
- Adding more scripts
- File editor
- Arrange access to wrkgrp folder

Also, nearing the end of sprint 2 we can get user feedback. Helmer knows people with a ‘u-number’ and ’s-number’ that are willing to test it. Also, we can already contact Wieke right now if we need tests on the intermediary product. We just need to send Helmer an email as soon as we want this.

Comments regarding the forced aligner. There are two versions, NL and EN. Right now it doesn’t matter which one we use since we can easily plugin the other version into the Clam wrapper. Sometimes Henk and Helmer spot issues in the NL version of the FA. The known issues are in the manual, and they are something to keep in mind. 

Last remark about the grapheme phoneme conversion. If words are not added in the lexicon (which is a text file) then they need to be able to be added. We can just edit this text file. For the conversion there is already a tool. We could use the tool, it’s part of the clam server after all. Maarten and Louis are the owner of this software piece.
