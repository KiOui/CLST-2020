# Client meeting April 21th 2020
Henk is canceld due to personal circumstances.
Louis is joining the meeting.

## Stand van zaken


## Demo
Show what we got

## FA: which version?
 - we stay with the current, but lose visualisation (and maybe more?)
 - we reimplement Maarten van Gompels FA in a CLAM-server but it takes us a full sprint to do so

## CTM visualisation
