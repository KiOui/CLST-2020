# Report Februari 5

This is the first weekly-ish report. This report will be drafted for two reasons:
- for groupmembers that missed a meeting and want to catch up
- for directors to keep an overview of our project

## The team
After the initial lecture we had a nice little meeting round. However our team spontaniously increased by 66,67%, after an e-mail that also notified us that our customer would not meet us today. This was especially saddening since we did not have any task description. At last we finally got a pdf and started!

The group of engineers consisted of 8 motivated students. All of them have finished the main programming courses of the Computing Science bachelor. 3 of them have experience with setting up websites. We have one security enthousiast.

We decided to communicate via Discord. Suzie and Jacob, two of the directors, have been added too.

## The client
Sadly, we could not yet meet with the client, so we based our preliminary requirements fully on the project document. We thought it would be more effective to discuss this only superficially with the engineers, so after 10 minutes of general discussion, we send them home.

The questionlist that we drafted can be found in our git repo. 

We e-mailed the client to propose a first meeting as soon as possible.
