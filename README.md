Getting started
---------------

Starting the Django server

0. Get at least Python 3.7 and install poetry and the requirements as per below.
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure `poetry` uses your python 3 installation: `poetry env use python3`. If pycrypto fails, make sure to download:
sudo apt-get install python3.7-dev
3. Run `poetry install`
4. Run `poetry shell`
5. `cd equestria`
6. `./manage.py migrate` to initialise the database
7. `./manage.py loaddata clam` to load the test CLAM server into the database (don't forget to set the CLAM passwords in step 11!)
8. `./manage.py createsuperuser` to create the first user
9. `./manage.py runserver` to run a testing server
10. `./manage.py process_tasks`to run the background tasks (glue between django and CLAM, for update status etc).
Starting the CLAM test server
11. To use the website, you also need to put in the passwords for the CLAM servers that were in the fixtures in step 7. Go to the admin page of django and enter the CLAM passwords in the scripts stored under scripts/scripts on the admin page.

1. In another shell, execute `cd fa-clam`.
2. Make sure `poetry` uses your python 3 installation: `poetry env use python3`
3. Run `poetry install`
4. Run `poetry shell`
5. `cd FAclam`
6. `./startserver_development`

Adding an application to the Django migrations

Execute `./manage.py makemigrations app1` when adding app1 to database
