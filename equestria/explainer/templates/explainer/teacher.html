            This explainer will try to elaborate upon all features provided by Equestria and will also discuss how to
            manage these features in the backend of this application. First of all, make sure you are logged in to an
            administrator account.

            To get an insight in how this application works it might be best to first read the
            <a href="{% url 'explainer:students' %}">Student explainer</a> as this already shows an insight into how
            this application works.
        </p>
        <h2>Overview of the application</h2>
        <p>
            This application provides a way to chain <a href="http://proycon.github.io/clam/">CLAM servers</a> together
            and form a Pipeline. Users can then use these Pipelines to easily process their input files without having
            to download/upload them to different servers or without having to use command line based scripts for file
            processing. At the core of this application there is an interface to talk with these CLAM servers and
            register them within our application. Built on top of that is a way to register Pipelines by using these
            established interfaces with CLAM servers. Below you will find an overview of the application in graph
            format.
        </p>
        <img src="{% static 'explainer/img/application-overview.svg' %}" alt="Application overview"/>
        <h2>The administrator interface</h2>
        <p>
            We will start by explaining the administrator interface. The administrator interface can be accessed
            <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">here</a> and provides a way to configure this application. Each installed
            application is displayed with a
            <span style="text-transform: uppercase; background-color: #79aec9; color: #fff; padding: 8px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">Blue header</span>.
            Each different model within an application is displayed as a link below a header. We will run through the
            applications in a step by step manner explaining what each application adds to Equestria and how to
            configure each application.
        </p>
        <h2>The Scripts application</h2>
        <p>
            The Scripts application is the most important application as it provides a way for the webserver to
            communicate with CLAM servers. A quick overview of the installed models in the Scripts application are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choice parameters</strong>: Choice parameters are parameters that have options. These options
            can be edited under this model.</li>
            <li><strong>Input templates</strong>: Input templates are settings for one file of a Profile. Input
            templates are connected to Profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Output templates</strong>: With Output templates you can select which files of the output
            of a script must end up in the users project directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Parameters can be defined if a CLAM server requires them. These can be used
            to, for example, set the language for a G2P script.</li>
            <li><strong>Profiles</strong>: Profiles specify which files should be uploaded before starting a script on
            a CLAM server.</li>
            <li><strong>Scripts</strong>: Scripts are used to provide the credentials to authenticate with a CLAM
            server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will go over the entire Scripts application by showing how to add a new CLAM script to Equestria.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding a CLAM script</h3>
        <p>
            To add a CLAM script to Equestria, head over to the Scripts tab under the Scripts application on the
            administrator dashboard. Here you can either view already added scripts or add one yourself by clicking the
            "Add script" button in the top right corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Script requires at least a name and a hostname to be set. The hostname must be a full URL such as:
            <code>https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/forcedalignment</code>. If the server at the entered hostname requires
            authentication then the username and password field should also be used to store the authentication details.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are done entering the details for a Script, click the SAVE button in the bottom right corner of
            the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we can do two things, either copy over the Profile and Parameter information from the CLAM server and
            link it to the Script we have created or we can do this automatically by clicking the "Save and refresh"
            button in the bottom right corner of the screen. This option will automatically download the profile and
            parameter data from the CLAM server and mirror it within Equestria. You will see the profile and
            parameter data pop up under the PROFILES and PARAMETERS tab on the configuration page of the Script.
        </p>
        <h3>Configuring Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            If you have done the above steps correctly you will notice that the PARAMETERS tab could include new
            parameters (if the CLAM server had any specified). Remember the names of the parameters as we will need to
            use them later. For now, go back to the <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">administrator dashboard</a> and
            click on Parameters under the Scripts application.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will see the parameters that were created for the Script in the previous tab displayed in the list here.
            To edit a parameter, click on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the parameter configuration screen, you can see what the name of a parameter is, to what Script it
            belongs and what the type of the parameter is.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, all parameters are not "Preset". This means that the users will be given the option to set this
            parameter to any value they like. To create a preset for a parameter (such that users do not have to set
            these parameters themselves), you can tick the "Preset" box on the parameter configuration window. When
            doing this you also have to specify a value for the parameter in the corresponding type. So if the "Type" of
            a parameter is set to "Choice" and you want to specify a preset, tick the "Preset" box on the parameter
            configuration window and choose a value from the values in the "CHOICE PARAMETERS" box. If the parameter
            has a different type then you must specify the value in its corresponding "[TYPE] PARAMETERS" box.
        </p>
        <h3>Changing Profiles</h3>
        <p>
            Just as with the Parameters, we can also edit the Profiles that the automatic importer of CLAM data imported
            for us. Note that this is not a necessary step and can even be discouraged as the interface with the CLAM
            server might stop working due to a configuration error.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, check the names of the Profiles associated with the Script on the Script configuration page. Then
            head over to the Profiles under the Scripts application and click the corresponding Profile. Here you can
            see all Input template files associated with the Profile and edit any details about them.
        </p>
        <h3>Configuring Output templates</h3>
        <p>
            Output templates are used when a process finishes. By default, no output files for a process are copied over
            to the project that started the process. When this must happen, you have to specify Output templates under
            the Output templates settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifying an output template is easy and requires three things, a name so it is easily recognizable in the
            future (such as "all log files"). A Script the output template belongs to, when a Process of that Script
            finishes, all output files corresponding to at least one template will be copied over to the project that
            started the process. The last thing that must be specified is a regular expressing (regex), more information
            about regular expressions can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">here</a>.
            When a Process finishes, all regular expressions of the Output templates corresponding to the Script of the
            Process will be matched against the file names of the output files. If a file name matches one of the
            regular expressions it will be copied over to the Project. Examples of regular expressions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>.*\.log</code>: This regular expression matches all files ending in <code>.log</code></li>
            <li><code>g2p_problematic_words.dict</code>: This regular expression matches files with filename
                <code>g2p_problematic_words.dict</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Projects application</h2>
        <p>
            The Projects application in the administrator dashboard can be used to get an overview of all the Projects
            and Files stored within those Projects on the server. Configuration for the Projects application is not
            necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>The Processes application</h2>
        <p>
            The Processes application includes all necessary features to manage Processes. A Process is created for
            each Script that a User runs. The only thing that could be set up in the Processes application is File
            Presets. As stated in the <a href="{% url 'explainer:students' %}">Student explainer</a>, Forced Alignment
            can be configured automatically using the
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Configure file settings automatically</button> button. This
            button tries to match file extensions to the extensions provided in the Input templates. With File Presets
            you can do even more and connect specific files to specific Input Templates. As an example, consider the
            input of the G2P process which is a <code>.txt</code> file. When a student is running a Pipeline, there
            could be multiple <code>.txt</code> files within a Project and the automatic configuration tool will thus
            fail as there are multiple <code>.txt</code> files and any could be used to run the G2P process. To
            circumvent this we could specify a specific regular expression that should be treated as a preference for
            a specific Input template. We could thus specify as a regular expression that
            <code>g2p_problematic_words.txt</code> should always be used as an input for the G2P process.
        </p>
        <h2>The Pipelines application</h2>
        <p>
            The Pipelines application provides a way to connect Scripts into a Pipeline. For now, you can connect a
            Forced Alignment script to a Grapheme to Phoneme script and give it a name. Users can create Projects for
            a Pipeline.
